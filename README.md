# Playground

Beware, nothing here is meant to make sense. Don't expect quality or any logic. It's just random tests.

## What is this all about?

More often than not, I find myself tinkering with some random idea or explaining something to someone. And usually, I create a "test" folder in my home directory to try that idea, to later delete it if I remember to do so.

But sometimes, I find what I wrote interesting to store somewhere for future reference, share it, or because it was fun to write.

So I said to myself: why not have an always-ready folder so I can jump right into it? I do want a mono repo like the cool kids!

Think about this repository like it would be some pastebin or gist but easier to work on for me.
